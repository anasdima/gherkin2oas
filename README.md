# gherkin2oas
The Gherkin Specification Document and the gherkin2oas tool is a system that I designed and developed as part of my Diploma Thesis in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The goal of the system is to assist developers in documenting customer-friendly RESTful Web API functional requirements.
